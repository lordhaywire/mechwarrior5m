# Mechwarrior 5 Mercenaries Mods I am Using

This has a link to the mods or it says Steam Workshop next to it if I got it from the Steam Workshop.

I included all the files for the ones I downloaded (but not the Steam Workshop ones) and some I am not using right now.  You can turn them on and off in the Mechwarrior 5 Merc Mod options.

[Expanded Logos](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/381) - Both 0 and 1.  None of the other files.
