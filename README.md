# Mechwarrior 5 Mercenaries Mods I am using

I have compiled all the Steam mods into this collection: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2923486435 all you need to do is subscribe to all of them in the list.

For the other ones you can just download all of them from this repository and dump them into your mods folder for Mech Warrior.

## Steam Workshop

These ones are from the Steam Workshop that are included in the collection above.

### Yet Another Mechlab

### Yet Another Mechlab Clans

### Yet Another Mechlab Mechs

### Yet Another Mechlab Weapons

### Pilot Overhaul

### No Max Tonnage

### MW5 Compatibility Pack



## Nexus Mods - It looks like all of them are currently on Steam.  When the Coyotes Missions gets updated either on Nexus Mod or Steam then I will add it to the list.
