# Mechwarrior 5 Mercenaries Mods I am using

This has a link to the mods or it says Steam Workshop next to it if I got it from the Steam Workshop.

I included all the files for the ones I downloaded (but not the Steam Workshop ones) and some I am not using right now.  You can turn them on and off in the Mechwarrior 5 Merc Mod options.

## Steam Workshop

These ones are from the Steam Workshop

### Remove JumpShip Animation

Removes the stupid Jumpship animation.

### Unlock Coop Tabs

I am not sure this does anything.

### Yet Another Mechlab

### Yet Another Mechlab Clans

### Yet Another Mechlab Mechs

### Yet Another Mechlab Weapons

## Nexus Mods

These ones are from Nexus Mods

### [Change Company Name](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/294)

### [Coyotes Mission](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/263)

### [Expanded Logos](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/381)

Both 0 and 1.  None of the other files.

### [Glowing Cockpit Blue](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/138)

I just thought this color was cooler then yellow

<!-- ### [Lore Armor Repair](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/93) -->

### [Pilot Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/477)

### [Max Tonnage](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/114)

### [MW5 Compatibility Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/mechwarrior5mercenaries/mods/168)

You need this for some reason.

I just picked one of the variations I thought would look the coolest.
